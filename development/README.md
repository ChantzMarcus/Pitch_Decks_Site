## Development Process

### 1. Research Phase
- Use the prompts in `research/perplexity_prompts.md` to discover new features and optimization strategies
- Document findings in the `findings/` folder
- Conduct competitor analysis in the `competitor_analysis/` folder

### 2. Design Phase
- Create wireframes and mockups in the `wireframes/` folder
- Develop visual design concepts
- Create user journey maps

### 3. Technical Planning
- Draft technical specifications in the `technical_specs/` folder
- Plan implementation approach
- Define API contracts and data models

### 4. Experimentation
- Build prototypes in the `experiments/` folder
- Test new features and concepts
- Validate assumptions with data

### 5. Testing
- Create test plans in the `testing/` folder
- Document test results
- Track performance metrics
