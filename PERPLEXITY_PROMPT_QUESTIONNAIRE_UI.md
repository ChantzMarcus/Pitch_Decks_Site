# Perplexity/AI Research Prompt: Premium Questionnaire UI Design

## Main Research Prompt

```
Research the latest questionnaire and multi-step form design trends for 2024-2025, with a focus on premium, high-conversion UI patterns. I'm building a story evaluation questionnaire for a film/TV pitch packaging service and need inspiration for:

1. **Modern Form Aesthetics:**
   - Glassmorphism and frosted glass effects in forms
   - Dark mode questionnaire designs with accent colors
   - Gradient backgrounds and animated elements
   - 3D depth effects, shadows, and elevation
   - Card-based question layouts vs traditional forms

2. **Progress Visualization:**
   - Creative step indicators (dots, circles, progress rings)
   - Milestone celebrations and micro-animations
   - Time estimates ("3 minutes remaining")
   - Visual progress momentum indicators
   - Step-by-step journey visualization

3. **Interactive Elements:**
   - Card-based option selection with hover effects
   - Selection animations (scale, glow, magnetic effects)
   - Button micro-interactions (magnetic pull, ripple effects)
   - Input focus animations and transitions
   - Real-time validation feedback

4. **Gamification Patterns:**
   - Progress badges and achievements
   - Completion celebrations
   - Progress rings and circular indicators
   - Unlock animations ("You've completed 50%!")
   - Visual rewards for milestones

5. **Entertainment Industry Examples:**
   - Film/TV production company questionnaire designs
   - Streaming platform onboarding flows
   - Creative agency form designs
   - Film festival submission forms
   - Studio pitch submission interfaces

6. **Technical Implementation:**
   - React/Next.js form animation libraries
   - Framer Motion patterns for multi-step forms
   - Tailwind CSS premium form styling
   - Accessibility considerations for animated forms
   - Performance optimization for smooth animations

Please provide:
- Specific examples from Typeform, Tally, Jotform, and modern SaaS platforms
- Code patterns and component examples
- Design inspiration from entertainment industry websites
- Best practices for maintaining usability while adding visual polish
- Accessibility guidelines for premium form designs
