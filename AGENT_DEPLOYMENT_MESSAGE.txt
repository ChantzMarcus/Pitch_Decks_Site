🚀 DEPLOYMENT REQUEST - Agent Instructions

Hi! I need you to deploy the latest changes to Vercel. Everything is already committed and ready to go.

WHAT TO DO:
-----------
Just run this command:
  git push origin main

That's it! Vercel will automatically deploy to filmdecks.biz.

WHY THIS IS NEEDED:
-------------------
The deployed site is missing:
1. Landing page animation (preloader)
2. Sonar hero feature (marquee background)
3. Has color inconsistencies (white sections mixed with dark)

All fixes are already committed in commit 5e5a84b. They just need to be pushed.

WHAT WILL BE FIXED:
-------------------
✅ Preloader animation will show (3.5s spinning logo)
✅ Sonar hero with marquee background will appear
✅ Unified dark theme (no more white sections)
✅ All animations will work

VERIFICATION:
------------
After pushing, check:
- https://filmdecks.biz shows preloader
- Hero has Sonar-style marquee background
- All sections are dark (no white)
- Animations work

STATUS: Ready to deploy - just needs git push
COMMIT: 5e5a84b (already committed)
ACTION: git push origin main

Thanks!
